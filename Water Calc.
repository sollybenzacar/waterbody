human body about 75 percent water.

0.1 x 5.97219×1024 kg = moon's mass

.17 x 0.99732 g = moon's Gravity


equation is \vec F_g = - \hat r ~ G ~ \frac{M m}{R^2}

equation is \vec a_g = - \hat r ~ G ~ \frac{M}{R^2}

tide-raising force (acceleration) due to the Sun is about 45% of that due to the Moon

Approximation of moons tidal pull
equation is \vec a_t(axial) ~ \approx ~ \pm ~ \hat r ~ 2 \Delta r ~ G ~ \frac{M}{R^3}

The tides in the seas are caused by the gravitational pull of the the Moon. When the Moon comes near to Earth, it can cause some sort of disturbances in the animals. They may act strangely or may have some neurological problems on the day when Moon comes nearer to the Earth.

moons pull on earth

F = Gmm/r²
F = [6.67e-11][7.3477e22][5.9742e24] / [3.844e8]²
F = 1.98e20 N

The moon exerts about 198 exanewtons of force on the Earth, and vice versa (by Newton's third law). 

exanewton

    The newton (symbol: N) is the International System of Units (SI) derived unit of force. It is named after Isaac Newton in recognition of his work on classical mechanics, specifically Newton's second law of motion.
    
An exanewton (EN) is a SI-multiple (see prefix Exa) of the force unit newton and equal to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 newtons

newton

the SI unit of force. It is equal to the force that would give a mass of one kilogram an acceleration of one meter per second per second, and is equivalent to 100,000 dynes.
